# React-Trivia-Game
Created with CodeSandbox

A simple trivia app where users can answer trivia questions (shows them whether they are right or wrong) and create their own trivia questions, categorized.

(TODO) Need to fix bug where we get a TypeError when writing new answer choices when creating a new question. I think this is a ES6 syntax issue because the code worked fine in code sandbox (where it was originally written) but has a couple issues when working on it locally.
